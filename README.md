## Astro

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Blog.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Hamburger.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Navigation.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Social.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Tag.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ BaseLayout.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ MarkdownPostLayout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ recipes/
|           â””â”€â”€ 0001_lavacake.mdx
|           â””â”€â”€ 0002_creme_brulee.mdx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tags/
|           â””â”€â”€ [tag].astro
|           â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ blog.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

A change of pubDate from pubDate: "02.22.2024" to pubDate: "22.02.2024" will lead to an build (`npm run build`) error.
